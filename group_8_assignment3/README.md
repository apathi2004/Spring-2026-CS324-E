# Assignment 3

## extract_words.py
### Files:
Input File: `DollsHouse.txt`

Output Files:
1. `allwords.txt`
2. `uniquewords.txt`
3. `wordfrequency.txt`

### How To Run Program:
The file `extract_words.py` can be run on any .txt word file, but the path must be put into the variable `filename` under the `main()` function. The file can then be initialized using the IDE of choice and pressing "Run Python File". This will then generate the output files:
+ `allwords.txt`: containing every word of the input file on a separate line.
+ `uniquewords.txt`: Containing every unique (used only once in the input file) word on a separate line.
+ `wordfrequency.txt`: Contains the frequency of words to number of words with that frequency, and line by line is sorted by increasing the value of frequency of word used in the input file.
