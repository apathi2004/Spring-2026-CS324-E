Group 8 – Assignment 4 Description

For this assignment, we built a hierarchical animation of two rockets launching and moving across the screen. The goal was to clearly show parent-child relationships using matrix transformations while keeping the animation visually interesting. Each rocket acts as a parent object. The body, nose cone, fins, and flames are child components attached through local transformations. The root matrix controls the rocket’s overall position and motion, and each part applies its own local offset relative to that root. This lets the entire rocket move as one unit while keeping each piece positioned correctly.

Advaiith wrote most of the class structure and handled the core hierarchy. He organized the Rocket class and its components, set up how matrices are passed down, and made sure each part uses local transforms instead of hard-coded positions. Steven focused on animation and visual refinement. He adjusted horizontal and vertical movement to make the rockets feel smoother, added scaling to the flames so they grow and shrink over time, and changed one rocket’s flame color to red to distinguish the two instances. Harris reviewed the structure and made small adjustments to keep everything cohesive. This included refining matrix multiplication order, checking that child transforms were composed correctly, and cleaning up minor inconsistencies in positioning and scaling.

One challenge was getting certain shapes, especially the cone, to align properly with the body. We had to tweak positioning and scaling to remove gaps and avoid distortion caused by incorrect transformation order. The flame scaling also required careful handling so it didn’t unintentionally shift the rocket’s position. The final result shows two rockets built from the same hierarchical structure but with different positions and visual details. The animation demonstrates proper use of parent transformations and local child transforms while keeping the code organized and reusable.
